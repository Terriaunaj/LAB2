# Lab 2: Test-Driven Review


Welcome to CS 2334!
For our this lab, we will complete the following tasks:

1. Download the starter code from this GitHub repo.
2. Import the code into Eclipse.
3. Write methods that pass a set of provided unit tests.
4. Commit the code to GitHub.
5. Upload the source file to zyLabs.

## Import the Starter Code

The starter code comes preconfigured to run in Eclipse.
Import it with the following steps:

1. Click "File" in the menu bar at the top-left of the Eclipse window.
2. In the drop-down menu, select "Import...", which will open a new window.
3. Click the arrow next to "General", select "Existing Projects into Workspace", and then click the "Next" button.
4. Select the radio button next to "Select root directory" and click the "Browse..." button.
5. Navigate to the folder that contains the starter code and click the "Select Folder" button.
(Select the folder that contains the src folder, not the src folder itself.)
6. Check that the Projects pane contains a single item (which should not be named "src") and click the "Finish" button.
7. A folder named "Lab2" will appear in the Package Explorer on the left side of the Eclipse window.
8. Click the arrow next to Lab2 to reveal the src folder.
9. Click the arrow next to src to reveal the default package.
(Java projects with multiple source files can be organized into different packages to avoid namespace conflicts.
The starter code, however, only uses the default package.)
10. Click the arrow next to the package to reveal the source files: Java1Review.java and JUnitTests.java.
Double-click the files to open them in the editor.

If you accidentally import the wrong folder, delete it from the Package Explorer and try again.
Before reimporting, check that Eclipse didn't create any extra hidden files in the project folder.
(Hidden files have names that begin with a period, and, by default, can't be seen in a file browser.)
To view the hidden files, follow these steps:

* Windows: Open File Explorer, select "View" from the menu bar, and check the box next to "Hidden items".
* macOS: Open Finder and type the keyboard shortcut Command + Shift + Period.

Compare the root of the project folder and the src subfolder to those in your GitHub repo.
Delete any files on your computer that are not in the repo and then follow the import instructions above.

## Run the Unit Tests

Take a look at the class JUnitTests.
This is a JUnit test class.
Notice that each method is prefixed with the annotation `@Test`.

Right-click the file JUnitTests.java in the Package Explorer and select "Run As" > "JUnit Test" from the context menu.
You will receive a warning that errors exist in the project, but click the "Proceed" button anyway.

A new tab will open next to the Package Explorer named "JUnit".
The tab includes a list of all the methods with the `@Test` annotation.
Each of these methods is a test, and they're all failing!

The goal of this assignment is to add code to the class Java1Review so that all of the tests pass.
(Don't change the code in JUnitTests.)
You'll know you're making progress when some of those red X's turn into green check marks.

## Write the Java1Review Class

Let's take a closer look at the first test in JUnitTests, which I'll duplicate below.

```java
@Test
void testFloatingPointDivision() {
    assertEquals(4.0 / 4.0, Java1Review.divide(4.0, 4.0));
    assertEquals(4.0 / 3.0, Java1Review.divide(4.0, 3.0));
    assertEquals(4.0 / 2.0, Java1Review.divide(4.0, 2.0));
    assertEquals(4.0 / 1.0, Java1Review.divide(4.0, 1.0));
    assertEquals(Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY, Java1Review.divide(4.0, 0.0));
}
```

The test, which is named "testFloatingPointDivision", calls the assertEquals method five times.
(If you look at the other tests, you'll see that they also call methods with names that begin with "assert".)
This is a special JUnit method that defines the test criteria.
To pass the test, `assertEquals` must be given two equal inputs every time it is called.
If `assertEquals` is called anywhere in `testFloatingPointDivision` with *unequal* inputs, the test fails.

Now notice that the second input to `assertEquals` is always a call to a method named "divide" in the class Java1Review.
This implies that `testFloatingPointDivision` is testing the Java1Review divide method.
Each time `assertEquals` is called, it checks the output of `divide`.
By looking at the inputs to `divide` and the first input to `assertEquals`, we can see that `divide` should divide its first argument by its second and return the result.

Each method in JUnitTests tests a different method in Java1Review.
By studying the tests, you can figure out how each Java1Review method should work.
Your job is to write the Java1Review methods so that they pass the tests.

### Getting Started: Write Method Stubs

The starter code for Java1Review includes only the class declaration and the main method.
A good way to start this assignment is to write [method stubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub).
A stub consists of a method declaration and an arbitrary return value.
For instance, if you know a method returns an integer, the body of the stub could be `return 0;`.

For each test in JUnitTests, write a stub for the Java1Review method being tested.
Think carefully about the method declarations.
In particular, ask yourself these questions:

* What is the data type of each input?
* What is the return type?
* Should the method be static?
* Should the method be public or private?

You'll know a stub is correct if the method is no longer underlined in JUnitTests.

### Debugging: Use the JUnit Tab

When you run the unit tests in Eclipse, a tab opens next to the Package Explorer that contains two panes.
The top pane shows a list of the tests.
If you click on a failed test in the list, its failure trace is shown in the bottom pane.
The information in these panes can be extremely useful for debugging your code.
In particular, note the following:

* If a test is red, your code produced an error.
(Check the method signature and return statement.)
* If a test is blue, one of the assert methods failed.
That is, the output of your code did not match the expected output.
* For blue tests, the top line of the failure trace shows the inputs to the failed assert method.
You can view this information in a separate window by right-clicking the line and selecting "Compare Result".
The output of your code is shown in the "Actual" pane; the correct output is shown in the "Expected" pane.
* The second line in the failure trace shows the line number of the failed assert method.
Right-click the line and select "Go to File" to highlight the assert method in the text editor.

## Commit to GitHub

It's good practice to commit your code to GitHub after you pass each unit test.
Below are instructions on how to do this with a web browser.

1. Navigate to the home page of your repo.

2. In the file browser at the top of the page, click the text "src" next to the folder icon.
This will open a new page that shows the contents of the folder: JUnitTests.java and Java1Review.java.
We want to replace the file Java1Review.java with the version on your computer that contains your code.

3. Click the "Add file" button in the top-right corner and select "Upload files" from the drop-down menu.

4. A new page will open with a rectangle that contains the text "Drag additional files here to add them to your repository Or choose your files".
Click the text "choose your files" and navigate to the location of Java1Review.java on your computer.

5. Scroll down the page to the rectangle that says "Commit changes".
Type a message in the text box that says "Add files via upload".
The message should be a [concise description](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) of the changes to the repo.
Something like "Implement methodName" (where "methodName" is the method that passed the test) is a good choice.
Notice that it's written in the imperative mood and does not end with a period.

6. Make sure the radio button is set to "Commit directly to the main branch" and then click the green "Commit changes" button.

7. Open Java1Review.java in the GitHub file browser to check that your changes were added.

Regularly committing your code may seem like a hassle, but there are some good reasons to develop this habit:

* If your computer fails, you have an online backup of your code.
* If you accidentally break your program, you can revert to an earlier version.
* If you get stuck on an assignment, we can view the code in your repo and give you feedback.

## Upload to zyLabs

After your code passes the unit tests, upload it to zyLabs.
(A link to zyLabs can be found on the Canvas page for this assignment.)
Your grade will be equal to the number of zyLab tests that you pass before the deadline.
The zyLab tests are similar to the JUnit tests, but they have slightly different inputs and outputs.
